              <strong>Effective date:</strong> 25.11.2025
            </p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              This Privacy Policy applies to the Komate app, which is developed and
              maintained by Marc Nelson and Timon Lapawczyk and published by <a href="https://klippros.com" target="_blank">Klippros Studios AB</a>.
              Klippros Studios AB provides the publishing accounts on Google Play and App Store Connect.
              Marc Nelson and Timon Lapawczyk are responsible for this app and its privacy practices.
              Komate does not collect, store, or transmit personal data to its own servers.
              All processing happens on the user's device.
              For questions or concerns, please contact
              <a href="mailto:hello@komate.app">hello@komate.app</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>What information does Komate obtain and how is it used?</h2>
            <p>
              Komate does not collect, store, or transmit personal data to its own servers.
              All processing happens on the user's device.
              Komate does not use analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or any data-collecting SDKs.
              Strava activity data is only accessed if you connect your Strava account, and
              it is processed entirely on your device.
            </p>

            <h2>Data from Strava</h2>
            <p>
              Strava activity data, profile information, starred segments, and segment efforts are accessed only with the user's explicit authorization.
              All Strava data is processed on-device and never transmitted to Komate servers or third parties.
              Users may revoke access at any time in Komate or via Strava settings.
            </p>

            <h2>Does Komate collect precise real-time location information?</h2>
            <p>
              Komate does not collect precise information about the location of your
              device. You can choose to enable location services in Komate to improve your experience.
              This information does not leave your device and is not stored or transmitted.
            </p>

            <h2>Local Storage</h2>
            <p>
              Komate stores app settings and cached data locally on the user's device to improve performance.
              This data never leaves the device.
            </p>

            <h2>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by Komate?</h2>
            <p>
              Komate does not share any information with third parties except as described in the Third-Party Technologies section below.
            </p>

            <h2>Third-Party Technologies</h2>
            <p>
              Komate uses open-source libraries and frameworks such as React Native and Expo to provide its functionality.
              These libraries run only on your device and do not transmit any data externally.
            </p>
            <p>
              Komate interacts with two external services:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Strava API:</strong> The user may choose to connect their Strava account.
                All data accessed from Strava is processed solely on the user's device and is never sent to Komate servers or shared with third parties.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>OpenMeteo API:</strong> Komate requests weather data for the locations of segments the user chooses for the current time or manually selected times.
                No personal data or device location information is sent to OpenMeteo—only the manually selected location and time parameters needed for the weather query.
                Weather queries sent to OpenMeteo contain no identifiers and cannot be linked to any individual.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Komate does not use analytics, advertising SDKs, crash reporting services, or any data-collecting SDKs.
            </p>

            <h2>What are opt-out rights?</h2>
            <p>
              Since Komate does not collect, store, or transmit personal data to its own servers,
              you may revoke Strava access at any time or uninstall the app to remove all locally stored data.
              You may also revoke Komate's access to location services at any time through your device settings.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>
              Komate acts solely as a local processor on the user's device. No personal data is processed externally or sent to Komate.
            </p>
            <p>
              You have the right to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Revoke Strava access at any time through the app settings or via Strava settings</li>
              <li>Uninstall the app to remove all locally stored data</li>
              <li>Contact us with any privacy concerns</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom, you have
              additional rights under GDPR, including the right to lodge a complaint with your
              local data protection authority.
            </p>

            <h2>Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
            <p>
              Komate acts solely as a local processor on the user's device. No personal data is processed externally or sent to Komate.
              The legal basis for any processing is your explicit consent when you connect your Strava
              account and use the app. You may withdraw this consent at any time by revoking Strava
              access or uninstalling the app.
            </p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              Komate does not collect or store personal data from anyone, including children.
              If a child connects a Strava account to Komate, access may be revoked or the app uninstalled.
            </p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
              All data accessed from Strava is stored locally on the user's device. Komate does not transmit any data externally.
              Users are responsible for securing their device through built-in features such as passcodes, biometrics, or encryption.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
              This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. The most current
              version will always be available at

              Consult this Privacy Policy regularly, as continued use of Komate
              constitutes acceptance of any changes.
            </p>

              Using Komate constitutes consent to the practices described in this
              Privacy Policy.
